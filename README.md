# SolarRes

This is a translation of an optimization of solar cells algorithim created for Viginia Tech's ECE Capstone 4085/86 class. 
I am translating it from matlab into python code, with the hopes of improving it based on the incorporation of the entire cell 
as a resistor, and eventually a web based drawing interface for calculations.
